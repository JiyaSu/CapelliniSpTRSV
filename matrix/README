matrix_name.txt lists the 245 matrices I used in our paper. You can download from https://sparse.tamu.edu.

Due to the limited space of the github repository, I only upload a matrix lp1.mtx here as an example. Other matrices can be downloaded from SuiteSparse Matrix Collection (https://sparse.tamu.edu).
